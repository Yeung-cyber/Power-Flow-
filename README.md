This code calculates the power flow of power networks, i.e. equilibrium points of nonlinear power systems.

The function of each file has been described as follows:

zdata.xlsx serves as the network's line data input and zdata.py reads the data from .xlsx file and develops a matrix in numpy to manage data.

ybus returns an admittance matrix of the network.
